# Overview

Rust is a systems programming language used to produce efficient low-level software. 

To learn the basic concepts of rust, I wrote a simple hangman game. The software implements common programming concepts including:
* variables and mutability
* data types (vectors, structures)
* functions
* control flow (condition statements, loops)
